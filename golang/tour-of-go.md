## Packages

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.

The environment in which these programs are executed is deterministic, so each time you run the example program rand.Intn will return the same number.

## Imports
This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

But it is good style to use the factored import statement.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}
```

## Exported names
In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

## Functions
A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

(For more about why types look the way they do, see the article on [Go's declaration syntax](https://go.dev/blog/declaration-syntax).)

_Go changes the order of the type placement to make function and type declarations easier to read ... particularly the more complex ones. In C the type comes before the variable name; in Go it comes after._

## Functions continued
When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

So `x int, y int` becomes `x, y int`.

## Multiple results
A function can return any number of results.

The swap function returns two strings.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

## Named return values
Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
	x = sum * 4 / 9
	y = sum - x
	return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(split(17))
}
```

A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.

Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

These short explanations are really good. And the white spacing too.

## Variables
The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A var statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
	var i int
	fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

## Variables with initializers
A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

## Short variable declarations
Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2
	k := 3
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

## Basic types
Go's basic types are

bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.

The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/cmplx"
)

var (
	ToBe   bool       = false
	MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
	z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

## Zero values
Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

The zero value is:

  0 for numeric types,
  false for the boolean type, and
  "" (the empty string) for strings.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var b bool
	var s string
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
```

## Type conversions
The expression T(v) converts the value v to the type T.

Some numeric conversions:

var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)
Or, put more simply:

```
i := 42
f := float64(i)
u := uint(f)
```

Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion. 

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	var x, y int = 3, 4
	var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
	var z uint = uint(f)
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

## Type inference
When declaring a variable without specifying an explicit type (either by using the := syntax or var = expression syntax), the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side.

When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of that same type:

```
var i int
j := i // j is an int
```

But when the right hand side contains an untyped numeric constant, the new variable may be an int, float64, or complex128 depending on the precision of the constant:

```
i := 42           // int
f := 3.142        // float64
g := 0.867 + 0.5i // complex128
```

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	v := 42 // change me!
	fmt.Printf("v is of type %T\n", v)
}
```

## Constants
Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.

Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

## Numeric Constants
Numeric constants are high-precision values.

An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.

Try printing needInt(Big) too.

(An int can store at maximum a 64-bit integer, and sometimes less.)

```
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	// Create a huge number by shifting a 1 bit left 100 places.
	// In other words, the binary number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
	Big = 1 << 100
	// Shift it right again 99 places, so we end up with 1<<1, or 2.
	Small = Big >> 99
)

func needInt(x int) int { return x*10 + 1 }
func needFloat(x float64) float64 {
	return x * 0.1
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(needInt(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Small))
	fmt.Println(needFloat(Big))
	fmt.Println(needInt(Big))
}
```

## For
Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.

[_we quite like this, because there is less to learn._]

The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

the init statement: executed before the first iteration
the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.

Note: Unlike other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces { } are always required.

## For continued
The init and post statements are optional.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for ; sum < 1000; {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

## For is Go's "while"
At that point you can drop the semicolons: C's while is spelled for in Go.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for sum < 1000 {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

## Forever
If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed.

package main

```
func main() {
	for {
	}
}
```

## If
Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( ) but the braces { } are required.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func sqrt(x float64) string {
	if x < 0 {
		return sqrt(-x) + "i"
	}
	return fmt.Sprint(math.Sqrt(x))
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(sqrt(2), sqrt(-4))
}
```

## If with a short statement
Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.

Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if.

(Try using v in the last return statement.)

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
	if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
		return v
	}
	return lim
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		pow(3, 2, 10),
		pow(3, 3, 20),
	)
}
```

## If and else
Variables declared inside an if short statement are also available inside any of the else blocks.

(Both calls to pow return their results before the call to fmt.Println in main begins.)

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
	if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
		return v
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
	}
	// can't use v here, though
	return lim
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(
		pow(3, 2, 10),
		pow(3, 3, 20),
	)
}
```

## 
Exercise: Loops and Functions
As a way to play with functions and loops, let's implement a square root function: given a number x, we want to find the number z for which z² is most nearly x.

Computers typically compute the square root of x using a loop. Starting with some guess z, we can adjust z based on how close z² is to x, producing a better guess:

z -= (z*z - x) / (2*z)
Repeating this adjustment makes the guess better and better until we reach an answer that is as close to the actual square root as can be.

Implement this in the func Sqrt provided. A decent starting guess for z is 1, no matter what the input. To begin with, repeat the calculation 10 times and print each z along the way. See how close you get to the answer for various values of x (1, 2, 3, ...) and how quickly the guess improves.

Hint: To declare and initialize a floating point value, give it floating point syntax or use a conversion:

```
z := 1.0
z := float64(1)
```

Next, change the loop condition to stop once the value has stopped changing (or only changes by a very small amount). See if that's more or fewer than 10 iterations. Try other initial guesses for z, like x, or x/2. How close are your function's results to the math.Sqrt in the standard library?

(Note: If you are interested in the details of the algorithm, the z² − x above is how far away z² is from where it needs to be (x), and the division by 2z is the derivative of z², to scale how much we adjust z by how quickly z² is changing. This general approach is called Newton's method. It works well for many functions but especially well for square root.)

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Sqrt(2))
}
```

```
func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
	z := 1.0
	for {
		fmt.Println(z)
		if math.Abs(z*z - x) < 0.000001 {
			return z
		}
		z = 0.5 * (z + x/z)
	}
}
```
