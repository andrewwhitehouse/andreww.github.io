## Top 10 Narratives and Investment Themes

### Winter is Here

If tokens help solve the "cold start" problem of network effects-reliant businesses in their battle to disrupt incumbents, that's a good thing. Good token design will look more like growth capital than seed funding. ([Ryan's] litmus test has always been: does this token create an early user based and improve the product, or does it primarily reward the founders and VCs?) Tokens only work in markets where network effects could exist. Otherwise, you're transparently partaking in a multi-level marketing scheme.

Does a crypto product get better when more people are added, in terms of liquidity, user interactions, and/or application interoperability? Yes. If a token can accelerate a product's time to usability, and reward it's beta testers, it's a powerful tool.

### Crypto is Still Inevitable

Crypto remains inevitable because we've made significant progress in the build-out of bitcoin, stable-coins, distributed computing, blockchain scalability, decentralized financial primitives (DEX, lending, asset issuance), and governance structures.

Bitcoin has entered its “historic buy” range by several measures. Stablecoins now represent four of the top ten crypto assets. Their volumes rival global card networks and banks, and they can actually generate *sustainable* yield now that the true risk-free rate of return (U.S. Treasuries) is above zero.
The Merge, the software equivalent of the Moon Landing, went through without incident, and other Layer-1’s like Cosmos, Solana, and various rollup chains made significant breakthroughs as well. Fees are way down as a result!

NFTs are data wrappers that open the door for secure sharing or transactions of any intellectual property, synthetic asset, consumer digital good, or identity token on-chain. They may look like toys to start, but they are almost unfathomably important as a technical primitive. We now have true DAOs, with on-chain voting, delegation, and community treasury man- agement. These entities cross borders and allow for the rapid formation and wind down of online communities and collectively-managed property. We may be in crypto’s 3rd inning, but DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs have barely stepped into the batter’s box.

### Surviving Winter, Redux

If you’re reading this report there’s a good chance that you do, but are now wondering how best to
[navigate a prolonged winter](https://avc.com/2018/11/what-bear-markets-look-like/). The answer is as simple as it is challenging and unglamorous: Build!
In many respects, it’s easier to build in bear markets than bull markets. There are fewer distractions, real product-market fit becomes easier to identify without the noise of a token, and the weak and flaky contributors wash out of the market.

### How Low Can We Go?

Bitcoin’s parity with gold would yield a 25x return, so there’s a lot to like in adding a 4% position in digital gold for every ounce of gold you buy. At today’s prices, bitcoin-gold parity would bring us a $500,000 bitcoin.

2. Ethereum: Is ETH a tech platform or distributed bank? A little bit of both, perhaps, but I’d argue the network is more comparable to the latter. The best comparisons to Ethereum on the tech side might be to AWS, Google, and Microsoft. After all, the protocol is a virtual machine and “world com- puter.” But its economic drivers (MEV and transaction fees), and unit economics (financial services’ basis points vs. cloud margins) make it look more like Visa or JPMorgan. There’s nothing wrong with that! Ethereum is already a top five financial platform if you look at financial services, and ETH has become a disinflationary asset with its Merge to Proof-of-Stake, minimizing the dilutive impact holders will experience going forward.
The question is whether you think there is enough real value flowing through the Ethereum platform today and in the medium-term to justify a 5x in valuation that would catapult the asset beyond fi- nancial services and onto the “Big Tech” leaderboard. I grok the favorable post-Merge Ethereum economics, but I don’t see a scenario where ETH leapfrogs Web1 giants any time soon. Too much of Ethereum’s current transaction processing is finance and trading related, and DeFi’s unit economics will face pressure in a high-inflation, high-interest rate environment.
Apple’s P/E is 23 and growing. Microsoft’s P/E is 24 and growing. Google’s P/E is 16 and growing. Ethereum’s “P/E” is 195, and its revenues are shrinking, with protocol revenues near multi-year lows.
The crypto market is still giving ETH simultaneous credit as a monetary asset (relative value to bitcoin), a computing platform (cloud startup multiples), and a yield generator (financial stock thanks to stak- ing). If any of those three narratives cool, it will face headwinds. (Long Bitcoin dominance?)

5. NFTs: Any given NFT project can go to zero, but NFTs as a data construct will eventually wrap around tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets. We’re at about $8 billion today, so there’s...uh... room to grow. But I’d rather be long picks and shovels infrastructure businesses vs. specific projects in the NFT space, as almost nothing I’ve seen has established a “fundamental” driver of value beyond art, and the jury is still out on which art will have staying power. You better like the jpeg enough to hold it forever vs. flip it.

6. DePIN: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN, or “token-incentivized,” TIPIN, which I don’t like and refuse to use, since it sounds like a NSFW government agency) will be one of the
most important areas of crypto investment for the next decade. Storage solutions like Filecoin ⭐ and Arweave, decentralized wireless networks like Helium, and other hardware networks are critical to the industry’s long-term viability. They could also disrupt an absolutely ginormous set of monopolies. Leg- acy cloud infrastructure is a $5 trillion global market cap sector, while DePIN is just a $3 billion market cap sector for crypto players. Not a bad sector to spend time in. We’re tracking it quarterly.

### Bear Market Building

If bear markets are for building, it begs the question: what should we build?

For context, let’s start with some history. In 2015, the answer was bitcoin trading and custody in- frastructure, and dozens of billion dollar companies were formed to provide the on-and-off ramps between the crypto economy and legacy financial system. In 2018, the answer was decentralized applications, and dozens of large DeFi (USDC, Uniswap, Aave), NFT (OpenSea ⭐, Punks, ENS ⭐), and decentralized infrastructure projects (Filecoin ⭐, Helium, The Graph ⭐) were incubated during the depths of winter, while Ethereum and an entire ecosystem of L1 and L2 blockchains emerged to satisfy demand for on-chain blockspace. Look at the biggest problem areas in 2022, and you’ll likely spot the sectors that will spawn the next unicorn solutions.

• Want to solve systematic risks? We’ll need investments in disclosures standards (hi, Messari!), proof-of-reserves and on-chain monitoring infrastructure, and crypto’s GAAP accounting moment to discern fundamentals vs. greater fool investing.

• Want to solve the hacking problems? This year was a disaster for on-chain hacks, whether it was poor smart contract design, economic model exploits, governance deficiencies, key security issues, social engineering attacks, and more. Solving security issues at scale (with AI monitoring, algorithmic circuit breakers, etc.) will be huge.

• Want crypto financial markets to be competitive? Over-collateralized lending isn’t too appealing vs. legacy finance. But you can’t have undercollateralized lending without major default risk...unless you can leverage new identity and reputation primitives.

• Want to ensure Amazon or Google or Apple can’t shut down crypto? We still need scalable de- centralized hardware networks, jailbroken device app stores, and decentralized data marketplaces that begin to siphon data from our soon-to-be unstoppable AI overlords.

• If you aren’t too creative, but you are entrepreneurial, you can always follow some of the biggest VCs in the space, and ask what they wish existed. A lot of them [publish requests](https://alliancedao.notion.site/Crypto-Web3-Startup-Ideas-48d40ccadeeb42a48056659fcce109b1) for startups, which provide a great starting point to get your creative juices flowing and find areas of interest and potential founder-market fit.
How can you not be excited to build? The spoils are there for the taking. We just need the right teams to get going and create the markets.
